# Welcome
This is my first notebook on Computer Vision. I have chosen the MNIST dataset where will train a model to read handwritten digits. MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. Here we have a multi-level classification task which we will solve using an artificial neural network.
